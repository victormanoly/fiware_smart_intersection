This is different than the vehicle type (car, lorry, etc.) represented by the `vehicleType` property. Enum:'municipalServices, nonTracked, private, public, specialUsage, tracked'. Tracked vehicles are those vehicles which position is permanently tracked by a remote system. Or any other needed by an application They incorporate a GPS receiver together with a network connection to periodically update a reported position (location, speed, heading ...).  - `color`: The color of the product  - `currentTripCount`: The current count of trips made by the vehicle corresponding to this observation on the given day of operation.  - `dataProvider`: A sequence of characters identifying the provider of the harmonised data entity.  - `dateCreated`: Entity creation timestamp. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateFirstUsed`: Timestamp which denotes when the vehicle was first used  - `dateModified`: Timestamp of the last modification of the entity. This will usually be allocated by the storage platform.  - `dateVehicleFirstRegistered`: The date of the first registration of the vehicle with the respective public authorities  - `description`: A description of this item  - `deviceBatteryStatus`: Gives the Battery charging status of the reporting device.

Enum:' abs, airbag, alarm, backCamera, disabledRamp, gps, internetConnection, overspeed, proximitySensor, wifi'. Or any other needed by the application. In order to represent multiple instances of a feature it can be used the following syntax: `<feature>,<occurences>`. For example, a car with 4 airbags will be represented by `airbag,4`.  - `fleetVehicleId`: The identifier of the vehicle in the context of the fleet of vehicles to which it belongs  - `fuelEfficiency`: The distance traveled per unit of fuel used, commonly in kilometers per liter (km/L).  - `fuelFilled`: Amount of fuel filled in liters to the vehicle corresponding to this observation.  - `fuelType`: The type of fuel suitable for the engine or engines of the vehicle corresponding to this observation.  - `heading`: Denotes the direction of travel of the vehicle and is specified in decimal degrees, where 0 <= `heading` < 360, counting clockwise relative to the true north.
